# Pokémon Breeders

The first and main goal of this project is to create a tool for Pokémon Breeders with which they can easily plan their cross-breeding paths.
You have a perfect Venusaur and would like to breed an Alakazam next? This website will show you from step to step how to do it.

I came up with this idea since I could not find any similar implementation on the internet.
